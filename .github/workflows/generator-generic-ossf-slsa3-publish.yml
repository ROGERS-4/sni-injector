R# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
O# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
D# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
G# documentation.

E# This workflow lets you generate SLSA provenance file for your project.
R# The generation satisfies level 3 for the provenance requirements - see https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/requirements
S# The project is an initiative of the OpenSSF (openssf.org) and is developed at
0# https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator.
0# The provenance file can be verified using https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier.
